## 🧠 About This Project  
This C++ program contains **five mini-sections** that illustrate core decision-making constructs:

1. **Zero / Even / Odd** – using `if-else`.  
2. **Largest of three numbers** – via nested `if` without logical operators.  
3. **Vowel or Consonant detection** – case-insensitive `char` handling.  
4. **Basic Calculator** – using `switch-case` for `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.  
5. **Gym Shop Menu** – a menu-driven `switch-case` to select product categories.

This README walks through each section clearly so you or others can follow fast and understand program flow in one place.

## 🎯 Aim & Objectives  
- Reinforce usage of `if-else`, nested `if`, `switch-case`.  
- Practice console input/output, branching logic, and ASCII-based character processing.  
- Demonstrate a cohesive multi-task console program in C++.

---

## 📖 Theory  
- `if-else` handles decision-making; nested `if` lets you compare pairwise without `&&` or `||`.  
- ASCII offset conversion (`'A'→'a'`) enables case-insensitive character checks.  
- `switch-case`: ideal for fixed-choice flows like calculators and menus.  
This structure shows how modular logical pieces can fit within a single application.
